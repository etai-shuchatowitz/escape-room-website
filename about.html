            Before there was a site, before the rites were digitized, there was Zola.

          <p style="margin-top:12px; color:#cfc2b5;">
            Zola Henderson’s communion with the spirit world began not with a séance,
            but with a dial-up modem that connected to something... unexpected.

          <h2 class="glitch">Zola Henderson (1949–?)</h2>
          <img src="images/zola_henderson.jpg" alt="Zola Henderson" class="profile-img">
          <p>
            Born beneath a blood moon in Ely, Nevada, Zola Henderson claimed to have spoken
            with spirits before she could walk. Her earliest memory was not of her mother,
            but of “The Woman in the Copper Mirror” — a figure she later identified as her guide between veils.
          </p>

          <p>
            By age twelve, Zola had authored her first spiritual manual,
            <em>The House Without Corners</em>, handwritten in red ink and banned from three libraries for "persistent
            humming."
          </p>

          <p>
            In the late 1980s, she retreated into the Mojave with a CB radio, 12 pounds of salt, and a laptop running
            Windows 3.1.
            She returned in 1999 with The Order of the Hollow Moon.
          </p>

          <blockquote>“Most people fear ghosts because they think they whisper. Mine scream. And I scream back.”<br>—
            Zola Henderson</blockquote>

          <p>
            A respected occultist in very small, very specific circles, Zola's specialties include:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-left:18px;">
            <li>Spirit Negotiation & Nonlinear Apologies</li>
            <li>Ghostbound Encryption</li>
            <li>Candle-Based Networking (CBNet)</li>
            <li>Remote Viewings via CRT Monitor</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            As of her last known communication (an MP3 uploaded via FTP at 3:33 AM on March 19, 2005), Zola claimed to
            be “between frequencies.”
            Her whereabouts are currently unknown. But activity on this site suggests she checks in from time to time.
